- 👋 Hi, I’m Latimer Galvan Harris-Ward (@lharrisw)!
- 👀 I’m interested in pure and applied mathematics and physics, as well as music composition, singing, hiking, and reading my Bible, to name a few.
- 🌱 I’m currently a Doctoral Student in Mathematics at the University of Arizona and a University Fellow!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to differential geometry, (geometric) analysis, mathematical modeling of physical systems, the mathematics of String Theory, and more!
